			<p>Entry #3:Hey guys zeke here and today it is july 23,2018 so i know i have been gone for awhile because <b id="anger">Because my phone won't TURN ON!!! I mean it still does work.
				but like my last phone was a samsung galaxy s7 active and i left it on the cha rger to long and a hole burned through it. So anyway, the phone i have now is a &quot;LG Phoneix 3&quot; i dropped it in the bathtub but we got it fixed and now when you press the power button it won't turn on and when it is completely shut down you have to hold the power button down right?? but it takes a long time to turn on and you have to let it sit for awhile before you turn it on and then when it's done charging i hold the button down 1 time it 
				actually    turned on and it took like 7 seconds but now it won't turn on at all it still works but the power button does not.</b>
				Ok so that rant about my phone is now over lets get into my new channel news station series i don't talk about the actual news i just talk about my channel,my videos,q&a's,upcoming projects,my life, and mostly my hobbies and what i do on my channel 
				and my youtuber/programming/witch problems so yeah and more Forever Wiccan news soon!</p>
